            <p class="lead">Here at Notorious Ventures we believe that it is always ideal for your competitors not to see you coming, but if they do, how do they feel?  are they fearful?  Are they spoiling for a fight?  We believe that the best defense is a strong offense and we also believe that in today's world the little guy, while always at a disadvantage, can practice great strategy and be more agile than corporate monoliths that will remain nameless.  Go ahead, be a guerrilla, we are there for you.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Whether it is in the area of protecting your ideas (getting the right IP) or understanding your situation (through sound competitive intelligence and modeling) we believe that the little guy should be well equipped.  All too often the big guys have all of the cards.  We deal you in.  At Notorious we want to help you avoid being intellectually prepared but light on assets.  We help you develop sound strategy, great IP positions around your great ideas, and a winning approach that lets the big guys know that they can not roll over you.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">How many times do you think early stage startups have had discussions with VC's or potential acquirers and heard this phrase?  Do you think it would be less prevelant in these types of discussions if the little guy had great protections on their ideas in addition to great ideas?  Do you think that the big guys would have a different perspective if you knew what their weaknesses were, or maybe which of their closets had skeletons in them?  At Notorious we believe that you should not have to be a multinational behemoth to have great IP and great competitive intelligence.  We always take the view that your ideas deserve the best possible protections and we will work for you to remove the above phrase from the conversations that you will have with the big guys or the guys that have your money.</p>
